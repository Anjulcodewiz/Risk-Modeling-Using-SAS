Here is a step-by-step explanation of the SAS code: 

Step 1: The code starts by turning on the `ods graphics` option and specifying the location of the `librisk` library.

Step 2: The `proc import` procedure is used to import a dataset named `Credit_Data.csv` from a specified location and create a new dataset named `loan_data` in the `librisk` library.

Step 3: The `data` step is used to manipulate the data and create new variables such as `Delinquency`, `fico_avg`, `last_fico_avg`, and `income_category`.

Step 4: The `proc contents` procedure is used to generate a report on the contents of the `risk_data` dataset.

Step 5: The `proc means` procedure is used to generate descriptive statistics for the numeric variables in the `risk_data` dataset.

Step 6: The `proc freq` procedure is used to generate frequency tables for the character variables in the `risk_data` dataset.

Step 7: The `proc sgplot` procedure is used to generate box plots and bar plots to visualize the relationship between different variables and the target variable (`Delinquency`).

Step 8: The code then removes outliers from the `annual_inc` variable and generates a histogram to visualize its distribution.

Step 9: The code also generates a donut plot to visualize the distribution of the `purpose` variable.

Step 10: The code uses the `proc surveyselect` procedure to generate a random sample of 10000 observations from the `income_no_out` dataset.

Step 11: The `proc sgscatter` procedure is used to generate a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables (`EMI` and `Loan_Amount`) and the target variable (`Delinquency`).

Step 12: The code then performs statistical data analysis using procedures such as `proc corr`, `proc glm`, and `proc univariate`.

Step 13: The code creates a new dataset named `loan_data` that contains only the relevant variables for further analysis.

Step 14: The code uses the `proc stdize` procedure to standardize some of the numeric variables in the `loan_data` dataset.

Step 15: The code then removes observations with missing values from the `loan_data` dataset.

Step 16: The code uses the `proc reg` procedure to fit a linear regression model to predict the target variable (`Delinquency`) using a set of predictor variables.

Step 17: The code uses the `proc logistic` procedure to fit a logistic regression model to predict the target variable (`Delinquency`) using a set of predictor variables, perform stepwise selection, and generate a ROC curve.

I hope this format makes it easier for you to understand how this SAS code works!
